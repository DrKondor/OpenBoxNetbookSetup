OpenBoxNetbookSetup
===================

My personal tweaks to the OpenBox WM -- specifically for the netbook - with a focus on usability and maximizing screen real estate. Features include no window borders! Basic tiling is available from the keyboard with Super+Arrow, (hold alt to drag windows around with the mouse) & super tiny font sizes. I also found variable transparency handy, so that's included as well. 

Have Fun!
